Specified the research problem we would like doing. That is, we will try to find a FPT algorithm for rank-k bimatrix game. 

Checked the paper that proved rank-k bimatrix game when k is no less than 3. Read the proof but is not totally understandable for me. I will continue reading the proof. 

Reviewed the report again to make sure our research direction is sound.  

Also I meet with my teammates in class and discussed how to distribute tasks. 

We scheduled a meeting on Thursday 11:30 - 12:30 
Other meetings weâ€™ll schedule

We plan to read the paper: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00453-011-9609-z.pdf

We decided to look at Max rank of two matrices individually and parameterize 2 Nash problem 

We intend to do: 
  Read reference one individually 
  Understand algorithm for nash equilibrium
  Review 2-3 relevant papers for the problems and post them on slack
