1. Considering how to apply positive affine transformation theorem to transform rank-2 bimatrix game to rank-1 bimatrix game for general case. However, I tried some methods but they fail for general cases. 

2. (In progress), while parameterizing the dimension of matrices, I'm considering special cases from dimension-2 and more. 

Since Thanksgiving, no meeting this week.
